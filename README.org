** Usage
- Install python 3.8 or later
- Install prerequisites
#+begin_src 
pip install holidays
pip install reportlab
#+end_src
- Edit config parameters in simcal.py
- Run the script
#+begin_src 
python simcal.py
#+end_src
- PDF file is generated for you to print: =cal<year>.pdf=

** Configuration
Edit =simcal.py= with your editor and save it.
You can configure:
- =year=: eg, 2023
- =start_weekday=: 1st day of the week 
  - 0: Monday, 1: Tuesday, 2: Wednesday, ... 6: Sunday
- =holiday_region=: Which country's holidays to put
  - 'JP': Japan, 'US': USA, 'GB': UK, 'IN': India, 'CA': Canada, etc.
  - You can choose any country that is supported by [[https://pypi.org/project/holidays/][holidays library]]
- =remove_1wk=: If the month has 6 week rows, remove the 1st week (=True=) or not (=False=); Because:
  - you might want wider spaces to write to
  - spaces for removed days are shown in the previous month, anyway;-)
- =pagesize=: either 0 (A4) or 1 (US letter)
